# ASSIGNMENT 1: FOUNDATIONS OF ADVANCED FRONT-END

## DEVELOPMENT

### Overview:

In this assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding of the foundational concepts
of front-end development covered in Weeks 1 through 4. You will apply your knowledge
of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to create a simple web application that
incorporates components, props, state management, event handling, and conditional
rendering.

### Objectives:

1. Set up a basic web application using React and Next.js.

2. Create multiple components and manage their state effectively.

3. Implement event handling for user interactions.

4. Use conditional rendering to display different content based on user actions or application state.

5. Style your application using CSS for a polished look.

### Deliverables:

1. Web Application:
  - Create a React web application using Next.js that includes:
  - A home page with a welcome message.
  - A navigation menu to navigate between components.
  - At least two additional pages/components that demonstrate different features.

2. Components:
  - Create at least three components, each handling its own state.
  - Use props to pass data between components.

3. Event Handling:
    - Implement event handlers for at least two different user interactions (e.g., button clicks,
      form submissions).
    - Ensure that user actions update the component state appropriately.

4. Conditional Rendering:
  - Use conditional rendering to display content based on the state. For example, show
    different messages or elements depending on user input.

5. Styling:
  - Style your application using CSS to enhance the user interface.
  - Ensure that your application is visually appealing and user-friendly.

### Submission Guidelines:

* Submit your web application as a GitHub repository link.
* Ensure your code is well-documented with comments explaining key parts of
  your implementation.
* Provide screenshots of your application in action, showcasing the functionality
  you implemented.

### Rubric:

1. Application Structure: Clear organization of files and folders - 1 point

2. Component Creation: At least three functional components with props - 2 points

3. State Management: Effective management of state across components - 2 points

4. Event Handling: Implementation of user interactions and state updates - 2 points

5. Conditional Rendering: Correct use of conditional rendering to display content - 2 points

6. Styling: Overall appearance and user experience of the application - 1 point
